    <h2>Welcome to Explore Nepal</h2>

    <p>Nepal is a land of breathtaking beauty, nestled in the lap of the Himalayas. From the majestic peaks of Mount Everest to the tranquil waters of Phewa Lake, the country is blessed with stunning natural wonders. Home to ten of the world’s highest mountains, Nepal is a dream destination for trekkers, climbers, and adventurers. But the charm of Nepal lies not only in its mountains, but also in its vibrant culture, rich heritage, and warm hospitality.</p>

    <p>The Kathmandu Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a treasure trove of ancient temples, palaces, and courtyards. Boudhanath Stupa, Swayambhunath (Monkey Temple), and Pashupatinath are just a few of the iconic sites that capture Nepal’s spiritual and architectural grandeur. In Bhaktapur and Patan, you will find medieval squares and streets that feel frozen in time, where artisans still practice centuries-old crafts.</p>

    <p>Beyond the cities, rural Nepal offers a glimpse into a traditional lifestyle shaped by nature and community. Villages in the hills and plains are vibrant with festivals, dances, and rituals that connect the people deeply to their land and beliefs. Whether you are trekking in the Annapurna range, canoeing in Chitwan, or enjoying local cuisine in a homestay, the experience is always heartfelt and unforgettable.</p>

    <p>Nepal is also a center for spiritual seekers. With roots in both Hinduism and Buddhism, the land is dotted with sacred sites, monasteries, and yoga retreats. Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, draws pilgrims from all over the world. The spirit of peace and harmony is palpable throughout the country.</p>

    <p>Tourism is a major part of Nepal’s economy, and travelers are always welcomed with genuine smiles. The infrastructure is growing, with increasing options for eco-tourism, adventure sports, cultural tours, and volunteer opportunities. Despite the challenges of development and past natural disasters, the resilience of Nepal and its people is remarkable.</p>
